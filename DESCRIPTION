Description: cogena is a workflow for co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis. It aims to discovery smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may be of great biological relevance. A novel pipeline for drug discovery and drug repositioning based on the cogena workflow is proposed. Particularly, candidate drugs can be predicted based on the gene expression of disease-related data, or other similar drugs can be identified based on the gene expression of drug-related data. Moreover, the drug mode of action can be disclosed by the associated pathway analysis. In summary, cogena is a flexible workflow for various gene set enrichment analysis for co-expressed genes, with a focus on pathway/GO analysis and drug repositioning.
