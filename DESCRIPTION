Description: Description: Gene set enrichment analysis is a valuable tool for
    the study of molecular mechanisms that underpin complex biological traits. 
    As the method is conventionally used on entire omic datasets, such as 
    transcriptomes, it may be dominated by pathways and processes that are 
    substantially represented in a dataset, however the approach may overlook 
    smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may be of great 
    biological relevance. In order to detect these discrete molecular 
    triggers, we developed a tool, co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis 
    (cogena), for clustering differentially expressed genes and identification
    of highly correlated molecular expression clusters. Cogena offers the 
    user a range of clustering methods, including hierarchical clustering, 
    model based clustering and self-organised mapping, based on different 
    distance metrics like correlation and mutual information. After obtaining
    and visualising clusters, cogena performs gene set enrichment. These gene
    sets can be sourced from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) or 
    user-defined gene sets. By performing gene set enrichment across 
    expression clusters, we find considerable enhancement in the resolution
    of molecular signatures in omic data at the cluster level compared to 
    the whole.
