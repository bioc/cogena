cogena can be used as gene set enrichment analysis of up or down regulated 
genes as well as genes in clusters resulting from various clustering methods. 
And the gene sets could be Pathway, Gene Ontology or user-defined gene-sets. 
Accordingly, this tool can be used for pathway enrichment, GO enrichment 
and so on. See the workflow of cogena in Figure 1.

![Overview of the cogena workflow](Cogena_workflow.png)

## Input data
    Note: all the gene names should be gene SYMBOL since it is used in the 
    gene dataset files. Other kind of gene names could be used according to 
    the kind of gene names of user-defined gene-set files.

1. Input data needed.

- the gene expression profiling of differentially expressed genes. It can be 
matrix with gene in row and sample in column, data.frame or ExpressionSet 
object.
- the sample labels indicating the labels, like control and disease, of each 
sample. A vector with sample names.

2. Example dataset.

    There is an example data in `cogena` package. This dataset, from 
    [GSE20163](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE20163), 
    is about Parkinson's disease. There are three objects in the PD dataset. 
    See `?PD` for more details.

```{r import_data, message=FALSE}
library(cogena)
data(PD)
# Three objects in the PD dataset.
```
```{r PD_data, echo=FALSE}
ls()
```

## cogena analysis

1.  Make Annotation

    There are a variety of gene sets in the `cogena` package, collected from 
    [MSigDB](http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). They are 
    `r  dir(system.file("extdata", package="cogena"), pattern="*gmt")`. with 
    gene-sets, user can get the genes-specific gene
    sets matrix as showed in the following example. Here the gene-sets can 
    be user-defined gene-sets formatted gmt, too.

```{r gene_list_annotation}
annoGMT <- "c2.cp.kegg.v4.0.symbols.gmt"
annofile <- system.file("extdata", annoGMT, package="cogena")
```

2. Run cogena

    Setting some parameters for cogena and running cogena analysis.
```{r cogena, results="hide"}
# the number of clusters. It could be a vector.
nClust <- 2:8
# the number of cores.
ncore <- 2
# the clustering methods
clMethods <- c("hierarchical","kmeans")
# the distance metric
metric <- "correlation"
# the agglomeration method used for hierarchical clustering 
#(hierarchical and agnes)
method <- "complete"

# the cogena analysis
cogena_result <- cogena(DEexprs, nClust=nClust, clMethods=clMethods, 
    metric=metric, method=method,  annofile=annofile, 
    sampleLabel=sampleLabel, ncore=ncore, verbose=TRUE)
```


## Analysing results of cogena
1.  After completing the cogena analysis, user can use `summary` to see 
the summary of the result of cogena. Since there are so many options of 
results, user can `optCluster` caculate wchih clusering methods and the 
number of clusters are optimum, and `enrichment` caculate the enrichment 
score of certain clustering methods and certain number of cluster.

    As so many clustering methods and a range of number of clusters 
    available, by setting the threshold of adjusted p-value as 0.05 
    so as to obtain the number of significant gene sets, we recommend
    that one can choose the clustering methods and the number of clusters,
    which is intuitively considered as the optimum, on which the number 
    of significant gene sets are local maximum. In other words, with the 
    cut-off of adjusted p-value, the optimum should have as many as possible 
    gene sets enriched in a local range of number of clusters. The reason 
    why choosing local maximum is largely because when the number of cluster
    is large and all clusters have more gene sets enriched, some clusters 
    are generated from cutting a cluster from smaller number of clusters,
    which are highly enriched with gene sets, into more clusters. We consider 
    the number of significant gene sets with the cut-off 0.05 of p-value as 
    the score. Moreover, for some clustering methods with a certain number 
    of clusters, if over 75% clusters possess a mixed up-regulated and 
    down-regulated genes, the score (except not available (NA)) will be 
    changed to inverse number. In addition, if the number of cluster is 
    2 and there are mixed up-regulated and down-regulated genes in each 
    clusters, the score (if positive and except not available (NA)) of 
    the other number of cluster for the same clustering method will be 
    changed to inverse number.

```{r cogena_result_analysis}
summary(cogena_result)
score <- optCluster(cogena_result, ncores=1)
#choose optimun based on cluster I.
#score <- optCluster(cogena_result, based="I", ncores=1)
```

```{r score, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(score)
```

```{r enrichment}
#Here we consider the "hierarchical" method and 6 clusters as the optimum.
#Always make the number as character, please!
enrichment.table <- enrichment(cogena_result, "hierarchical", "6")
```

2.  To show the enrichment graph, `heatmapPEI` can be used. see Figure 2. 
    See ?heatmapPEI for more details.

```{r heatmapPEI, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, fig.cap="KEGG pathway enrichment"}
#The values shown in Figure 2. is the -log2 (p-values).
#Always make the number as character, please!
heatmapPEI(cogena_result, "hierarchical", "6", printGS=FALSE)
#ordered by the Cluster I.
#heatmapPEI(cogena_result, "hierarchical", "6", orderMethod = "I")
```

3.  The heatmap of expression profiling with clusters is plotted by 
    `heatmapCluster`. see Figure 3. User can know which cluster contains
    up-regulated or down-regulated genes.

```{r heatmapCluster, fig.width=10, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Heatmap of expression profiling with clusters"}
#Always make the number as character, please!
heatmapCluster(cogena_result, "hierarchical", "6")
```

4.  If interested genes in a certain cluster, user can obtain the genes in 
    a certain cluster via `geneInCluster`.
```{r geneInCluster}
#Always make the number as character, please!
head(geneInCluster(cogena_result, "hierarchical", "6", "2"))
```

5.  The gene expression profilings with cluster infromation could be 
    obtained by `geneExpInCluster`. There are two items, `clusterGeneExp` 
    and `label`, in the returned object of `geneExpInCluster`. This can 
    be used for other application.
```{r geneExpInCluster}
#Always make the number as character, please!
gec <- geneExpInCluster(cogena_result, "hierarchical", "6")
head(gec$clusterGeneExp, 3)
gec$label
```

6. The correlation among one cluster could be shown via `corInCluster`. 
    see Figure 4.
```{r corInCluster, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Correlation"}
#Always make the number as character, please!
corInCluster(cogena_result, "hierarchical", "8", "8")
```
